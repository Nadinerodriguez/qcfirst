- Visual Design: Designed the sign up, login, homepage, and manage courses pages on Figma.
- HTML: I wrote the navbar and the entire HTML code for the sign up, log in, and homepage pages.
- CSS: I styled the sign up, login, course planner, course enrollement, and manage courses pages.
- Back End: Researched on what best technologies to use for the backend such as Firebase, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL and MongoDB. I set up the various routhings in the Node and Express server to serve all our web documents.

- Visual Design: Designed the course search, course planner, and course enrollment pages on Figma.
- HTML: I worked on the footer and the entire HTML code for the course search, course planner, course enrollment, and manage courses page.
- CSS: I styled the navbar, footer, homepage and course search page.
- Back End: Researched on what best technologies to use for the backend such as Firebase, Node.js, and Express.js. Tried using Firebase's Authenthication for the Sign Up and Login pages but later decided with my partner that his solution was the best approach in the long run. I created the students and faculty table on MySQL.

**Course Search Page**
- Students can look for courses they are interested in this page. They can either use the search for a specific course or use the search filter feature.
- Once a student searches for a class, the results will be displayed. They can either add it to their planner, enroll for the course or just browse through them.

## A summary of any differences between our visual designs and final outcome
- In our Visual Designs, we initially wanted the form in our sign up and log in pages to be on the right side of the page. But for the final outcome, we decided to just put the form in the center of the page. We also removed the "table" for our schedule in our final outcome. Instead of a table, we have the courses listed in rows. We also added a few buttons here and there, but other than that, there aren't too much differences between our visual designs and final outcome.
